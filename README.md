# interactive-socket-game

## Introduction
This is a small project I'm toying with to learn and experiment with ``Socket.io`` technology. The project is very simple, I took Google Chrome's TRex Runner Game and hooked some socket commands to it, which a mobile device would send. If you want to see a test you can check [interactive-socket-game.herokuapp.com](https://interactive-socket-game.herokuapp.com).

If you open the link on a desktop or laptop computer, you will see the game. If you open it from a mobile device, you will get a controller for the game.

Should you have a better name for the game, you are free to suggest. Just come up with one and open a pull request :)

Thanks and enjoy.
